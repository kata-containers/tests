# List 'egrep' patterns of files that can:
# - be skipped by the CI
# - force the CI to always run (cannot be skipped), even if they match the 'can
#   be skipped' patterns.
#
# Entries are of the form:
#  repo_name:
#    [skip_pattterns | check_patterns]: |
#     (list of patterns, ideally one per line)
#
# The repo name 'common' is special, in that it will apply to all repos being checked.
# The rules for 'common' and the repo under test are merged together before the checks
# are carried out.
#
# Missing repo sections and missing pattern sections are handled correctly.
#
# 'yq' has a bug (https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/issues/188) whereby the yaml
# parser tries to interpret '\.' as a special character expansion (like it would
# for '\t') in many YAML string types (which in itself I think is another bug),
# and explodes. Work around that by placing our pattern strings into a
# ['literal block scalar'](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2793652),
# that seems to work.
